Driven by AI's rapid progress and vast potential, I've developed a strong affinity for generative AI and data analytics and I'm eager to expand my expertise in these areas. My interests include cyber security, AI, web development, and trying to figure out what I want to do with my life - ("I'm not indecisive at all")
